# React + Vite

To start the project write npm run dev in your terminal.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

[2024-01-20] Note: The navbar decided to not be centered anymore, which it was previously, either vite CDN has changed something or my pc is crazy. So if something does not look proper then it might no be my fault.
